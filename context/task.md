# Frontend Take-Home Bundle Builder

## Overview

This is a frontend take-home. You'll rebuild the design below as a working

**React prototype**: a multi-step bundle builder with a live review panel beside it.

Build it the way you'd build production UI you're proud of.

## The design

- **Figma:** https://www.figma.com/design/JYf61etQVqeseX7oY5alGz/Frontend-Test-Figma?node-id=68-8088&t=eItHIh0U1JjjJF8d-1

## What you're building

A two-column experience.

**Left, the builder.** A vertical, 4-step accordion that walks the shopper through assembling their system:

1. **Choose your cameras:** expanded by default
2. **Choose your plan**
3. **Choose your sensors**
4. **Add extra protection**

Each step has a header showing a "STEP X OF 4" headline, an icon, the step title, and a state indicator on the right: the open step shows a "_N_ selected" count with an up-chevron; collapsed steps show a down-chevron. The expanded step ends with a **Next: …** button that advances to the following step.

**Product cards:** Each card can include an optional discount **badge** (e.g. "Save 22%"), the product image, title, a short description, a "Learn More" link, a **color/variant selector**, a **quantity stepper**, and **pricing** (a struck-through compare-at price plus the active price). A card with quantity greater than zero is shown in its **selected state** (the highlighted border in the design). Not every product has every element, some have no badge, and some have no variants at all. Reproduce what the design shows per product.

**The review panel ("Your security system"):** It's a summary that reflects the configured system. It lists selected items grouped under category subheadings (**Cameras, Sensors, Accessories, Plan**). Each line has a thumbnail, name, its own quantity stepper, and pricing. Below the line items: a shipping row, a satisfaction-guarantee badge, a financing line, the **total** (with the pre-discount price struck through), a savings callout, a **Checkout** button, and a **Save my system for later** link.

The Checkout button has nowhere to go in this prototype a placeholder or a simple confirmation is fine. The builder and the review panel are the focus.

## Requirements

### Fidelity (desktop)

Match the design precisely layout, spacing, typography, color, corner radii, and the various element states (selected/unselected cards, active/inactive color chips, disabled steppers).

### Responsiveness

Desktop must match the Figma; **smaller viewports are supposed to be responsive design.** We expect the layout to stay usable and visually coherent all the way down to a phone.

### Interactions that must work

- **variant selection:** see the dedicated section The variant selector.
- **Quantity steppers:** present on both the product cards and the review-panel lines, and kept **in sync** (changing one updates the other and the rest of the UI).
- **Accordion:** steps expand and collapse; Step 1 is open on load.
- **"N selected" counter:** reflects the number of distinct products currently chosen in that step.
- **Live review panel:** updates as selections change; the **total recalculates** as quantities change.

### Data

The app should be **data-driven from a JSON source you define** render from data, don't hardcode per-product markup. Seed the initial state so the app loads looking exactly like the design (including the review panel's pre-populated sensors, accessory, and plan, which have no add-control in this particular view). Serving that JSON from a small backend/API is a **bonus, not a requirement,** a local JSON file is completely fine.

## The variant selector

For products that have variant options, show a row of selectable color chips each with a small swatch/thumbnail and a label matching the design. The key thing to get right:

- **Each variant has its own quantity.** Red and blue of the same product are tracked separately, with separate counts.
- **The card's quantity stepper is bound to whichever variant is currently selected.** Selecting a color makes it the active variant, and the stepper shows and edits _that_ variant's count. Example: add 2 of Red, then select Blue the stepper now reads **0** (Blue's count), while the 2 Red you added are untouched.
- **The review panel reflects every variant with a count above zero, as its own line.** In the example above, switching the card to Blue does **not** remove Red from the summary Red (×2) still shows on the right.
- **Don't worry about the selected-chip styling / highlighting for now** focus on the selection-and-quantity behavior and that it flows through to the review panel.
- Products with **no color options** (e.g. the doorbell) simply have **no selector** the single quantity stepper just controls that product.

## Persistence "Save my system for later"

The **Save my system for later** link should actually save the shopper's configuration. When a shopper builds a system, clicks it, and comes back later (page reload or a return visit), their system should be **restored exactly as they left it**.

Use client-side persistence for this (localStorage is the obvious fit). The expectation is simply: configure → save → leave → return → it's all still there. How you structure what gets stored is up to you.

## Deliverable

A public GitHub repo. This repo should contain:

- The react source code.
- Your JSON data (and a backend, if you do the bonus).
- Clear **run instructions** in the readme file(e.g. install + start). Make sure it builds and runs from a clean clone.
- A short **README** noting any decisions, tradeoffs, or anything you didn't finish.
